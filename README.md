# VFX Hire Map

An example of how to use the Leaflet API with Mapbox in
order to provide job positions on a map.

## Development

Clone the repository and then run the following to develop locally:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:djthorpe/vfxhiremap
open http://localhost:8000/vfxhiremap/
python3 -m http.server
```

## Implementation

Sign up for an account with [mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/) and obtain
an [access token](https://account.mapbox.com/access-tokens/). Make sure this
is limited so that requests can only be made from the origination URL.

Implement the code in this repository on a hosted website. I recommend
[GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/). Then embed the map on your main
website through an `<iframe>`:
